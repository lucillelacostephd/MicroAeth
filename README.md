# MicroAeth Black carbon concentrations
This repository contains the preprocessing of black carbon data from MicroAeth after application of the Optimized Noise-reduction Averaging (ONA) technique in the MicroAeth Manager. The preprocessed data is used to estimate the black carbon contributions from fossil fuels and biomass burning. 

Note: Raw file needs to be rechecked. Currently coming from various sites in Albany (?). Add a column representing site name.
